# Temperature Conversion App
 ## Requirements
For this assignment, you will create a Temperature Conversion app according to the instructions  below,

- The app should allow the user to select either Fahrenheit-to-Celsius or Celsius-to-Fahrenheit conversions. No other conversion selections should be allowed, and one conversion must be selected at any given time (no situation where no conversion is selected).

- User the following formulae for conversion
°F = °C x 9/5 + 32   and °C = (°F - 32) x 5/9

- The initial temperature value should be entered by the user. 

- Pressing a Convert button should calculate the converted temperature value and display it on the screen. Converted values should be displayed out to 2 decimal places only.
  
- The conversion operation, value, and calculated results are added to the “history”:
  
Example:
F to C: 55.0  => 12.8
C to F: 3.5 =>  38.3

The app must look and act consistently in either portrait or landscape orientation.
Submission type: Link to your GitHub Repo and a 1-3 minute video demo
