# Temperature Conversion App
 ## Requirements
For this assignment, you will create a Temperature Conversion app according to the instructions  below,

The app should allow the user to select either Fahrenheit-to-Celsius or Celsius-to-Fahrenheit conversions. No other conversion selections should be allowed, and one conversion must be selected at any given time (no situation where no conversion is selected).
User the following formulae for conversion
°F = °C x 9/5 + 32   and °C = (°F - 32) x 5/9
The initial temperature value should be entered by the user. 
Pressing a Convert button should calculate the converted temperature value and display it on the screen. Converted values should be displayed out to 2 decimal places only.
The conversion operation, value, and calculated results are added to the “history”:
Example:
F to C: 55.0  => 12.8
C to F: 3.5 =>  38.3
The app must look and act consistently in either portrait or landscape orientation.
Submission type: Link to your GitHub Repo and a 1-3 minute video demo 

Below is an example of how the app might look. Note, DO NOT make yours look like this. Use your creativity in designing the UI for this app. Only make sure that all the content mentioned above is present in the app.

## Features
